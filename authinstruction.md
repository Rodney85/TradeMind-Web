I'll expand on each section and include details about handling payment failures/cancellations:

1. Landing Page (Next.js) Setup:
   - Install necessary packages:
     ```
     nextauth
     @convex/nextjs
     zod
     react-hook-form
     ```
   - Create authentication API routes
   - Set up environment variables for OAuth credentials
   - Implement protected API routes
   - Create reusable form components with Zod schemas

2. Database Schema (Convex):
```
Users Table:
- id: unique identifier
- email: string
- name: string
- authProvider: enum (email, google, apple)
- providerId: string
- createdAt: timestamp
- updatedAt: timestamp

Payments Table:
- id: unique identifier
- userId: foreign key
- status: enum (pending, completed, failed, cancelled)
- amount: number
- paymentMethod: string
- paymentIntentId: string
- createdAt: timestamp
- updatedAt: timestamp
- failureReason: string (optional)
- retryCount: number
```

3. Authentication Flow Details:
   
   Registration:
   - Collect user information
   - Validate using Zod schema
   - Check for existing email
   - Create user record in Convex
   - Generate session token
   - Redirect to payment

   Login:
   - Validate credentials
   - Query payment status
   - If paid → redirect to app with token
   - If unpaid → redirect to payment
   - Handle social auth callbacks

4. Payment System:
   
   Success Flow:
   - Create payment intent
   - Process payment
   - Update user payment status
   - Generate app access token
   - Redirect to app

   Failure/Cancellation Handling:
   - Implement retry mechanism (max 3 attempts)
   - Store failure reason in database
   - Show appropriate error messages
   - Provide alternative payment methods
   - Automatic email notifications
   - Support ticket creation option
   - Grace period for failed renewals
   - Payment recovery flow

5. App Access Control:
   - Middleware to verify tokens
   - Check payment status on each request
   - Handle expired sessions
   - Implement token refresh
   - Rate limiting
   - Activity logging

6. Inter-App Communication:
   - JWT for secure data transfer
   - Encrypted URL parameters
   - Shared session storage
   - State management between apps

7. Edge Cases & Error Handling:

   Payment Failures:
   ```javascript
   enum PaymentFailureType {
     INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS,
     CARD_DECLINED,
     NETWORK_ERROR,
     EXPIRED_CARD,
     AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED
   }
   ```

   Recovery Flow:
   1. Detect failure type
   2. Log incident
   3. Notify user
   4. Start recovery process:
      - For network errors: automatic retry
      - For card issues: prompt for new card
      - For authentication: redirect to 3D Secure

   Cancellation Handling:
   1. Update subscription status
   2. Save cancellation reason
   3. Initiate refund if applicable
   4. Send confirmation email
   5. Offer win-back options

8. Security Considerations:
   - CSRF protection
   - Rate limiting
   - Input sanitization
   - XSS prevention
   - Secure headers
   - Audit logging

9. Implementation Order:

   Phase 1:

   - User authentication
   - Database schema

   Phase 2:
   - Payment integration
   -  error handling
   - Essential security

   Phase 3:
   - Advanced error handling
   - Recovery flows
   - Monitoring
   - Analytics

10. Monitoring & Analytics:
    - Track failed payments
    - Monitor conversion rates
    - User journey analytics
    - Error rate monitoring
    - Performance metrics

# Game Plan: TradeMind Authentication Implementation

## Phase 1: Authentication Setup (TradeMind-Web)

### Authentication Configuration

Set up NextAuth.js configuration in app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts
Configure OAuth providers (Google, Apple) and email authentication
Create authentication middleware for protected routes

### User Management API

Create API routes for:
* /api/auth/register
* /api/auth/login
* /api/auth/verify
Implement Zod validation schemas in lib/validations
Set up Convex mutations for user operations

### Authentication UI Components

Enhance existing UI components with form validation:
Login form
Registration form
Email verification component
Add loading states and error handling
Implement form validation using react-hook-form and Zod

## Payment Integration

### Payment Setup
- Set up Paystack configuration
- Create payment API routes:
    * /api/payment/create-session
    * /api/payment/webhook
Implement payment status tracking in Convex
Payment Flow Components
Create payment UI components:
Payment selection
Payment processing
Success/failure handling
Add payment status indicators
Implement retry mechanism for failed payments
## Phase 3: Authentication Flow Integration
### Session Management
Implement session persistence
Create protected route middleware
Set up session validation checks
### Redirection Logic
Create authentication state management
Implement redirection rules:
Code
CopyInsert
Guest → Landing Page
Authenticated but not paid → Payment Page
Authenticated and paid → TradeMind-App
Phase 4: TradeMind-App Integration
Session Validation
Implement session checking on app load
Create authentication guard for app routes
Add token refresh mechanism
Error Handling
Create session expiry handling
Implement graceful logout
Add re-authentication flows
Implementation Strategy:
Work incrementally - implement one feature at a time
Test each component thoroughly before moving to the next
Keep existing UI intact while adding functionality
Use TypeScript for type safety
Maintain error boundaries to prevent cascading failures
Important Notes:
All authentication state will be managed through NextAuth.js
Payment status will be tracked in Convex database
Session tokens will be used to validate access to TradeMind-App
Existing UI components will be enhanced, not replaced
All forms will have proper validation before submission
